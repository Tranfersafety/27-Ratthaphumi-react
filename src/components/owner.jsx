        I am Ratthaphumi Sangthin. I just graduated from Generation Thailand
        Boot Camp #7. I worked in a laboratory for 3 years in the COVID-19
        field. During my work, I developed negotiation and teamwork skills. Now,
        I have decided to become a software developer who can build software and
        websites. I want to gain more knowledge and experience to answer any
        questions and help people who struggle with programming languages. My
        goal is to improve medical lab processes using programming and AI
        technology.
